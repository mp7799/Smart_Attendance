      <h1>About Website</h1>
      <p>Smart attendance monitoring system is an attendance portal where in students have to come online and mark their attendance. This is helpful when teachers have to take attendance online and a lot of time is spent on taking it. This website will help teachers in taking attendance from the users in Realtime and upload it in the database so that the data could be easily updated for the studentâ€™s reference also.
		Basically, the website includes five different modules which goes like home, mark your attendance page, records page, a query form, login and registration. So, a new student can register in the portal and enters the website by using its login credentials. After making a successful login, a student can mark the attendance at the time when slot is opened by the faculty. After the student marks the attendance, data goes to the server and is updates on the record page where students can see their past attendances. In a case if any student has any issue with the attendance, they may go to the query section where they are allowed to raise a query against their wrongly marked attendances. This way faculties can save their time taking attendance online and spend more time on teaching.
